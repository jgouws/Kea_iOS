/*
 Everything in this class represents code for the select photo screen. It inherits UIViewController which
 provide varies on call methods which are call depending on the app's state. States/methods like viewDidLoad,
 viewWillAppear, viewDidAppear.
 
 Other classes stated after that are protocols. Protocols are simalar to interfaces where certain functions require
 certain methods to be called, or you can override the optional methods. The most common protocols used (like in this
 code) are delegates.
 
 Delegates allow us to give different characteristics for the same type of UI object. Like a text field delegate
 can provide font details, or what to do when the return button is pressed.
